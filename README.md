## My Personal Startkit

This is a simple starterkit I threw together for myself to help boost my personal productivity. I often get reluctant on starting a project because tI need to setup a bunch of stuff before I feel ready to actually start coding on my project.

The surrounding tools I choose to use in this starterkit are the things I most commonly use, and am most comfortable with. So should I choose to try something new, I will just switch that piece out for something else :)
